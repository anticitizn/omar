Omar is a barebones library for rendering and handling bitmap text on the screen. It abstracts away all core graphical details and provides absolute control over the text field, allowing you to focus on your application and ignore all the pesky issues with drawing on normal terminals. It's also hardware-accelerated and runs anywhere where SDL does, so you don't have to worry about portability.
